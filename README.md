## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have a compatible programming environment, such as Python.
3. Import or include the Hangman Game module in your code.
4. Start a new game by calling the `start_game` function.
5. The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list or you can provide your own word list.
6. The player can then guess letters by entering them as input.
7. The game will reveal any correctly guessed letters in the word and display the current state of the word.
8. If the player guesses all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, they win. Otherwise, they lose.

The game will prompt the player to enter their guesses and display the current state of the word as underscores for the unknown letters.
